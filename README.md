This is my testbed/playground project for angularjs and sails.js. It isn't secured in any way.
DONT USE TRY THIS AT HOME.

# Install

*   `npm install`
*   clone [mongo adapter](https://github.com/hoschi/sails-mongo) into a directory
    *   change into this directory
    *   git checkout 0.8.4
    *   `npm link`
*   change back to project directory
*   `npm link sails-mongo-hoschi`

Now you can start the app with `sails lift`.
